### A little about me:

I've been working in the Public Cloud space as Cloud Developer/Engineer in varying sectors such as Public Sector (UK Govt), UK Financial Services, Oil & Gas and Freight and Logistics.
I build, break and fix on **AWS** and **Azure**, occasionally like to tinker with **GCP**.

### How long have I been doing things in Tech:

- Just over a decade overall but specialised in Cloud/DevOps over the last ~5 years

### What I've learned along the way:

- Public Cloud (AWS, Azure & GCP)
- Infra as Code (Terraform & Cloudformation)
- Configuration Management (Packer & Ansible)
- Shell/Scripting (Bash and PoSH)
- CI/CD (GitHub, Gitlab and even Jenkins)
- SysAdmin (Windows) and VirtualAdmin (VMWare, Hyper-V)
