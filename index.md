# Welcome to Shanils' Bucket of Stuff

Firstly, What is Bucket of Stuff?

Bucket of Stuff is simply just a phrase that I use to talk about my ramblings in the tech. It could be anything from IaaC, Python, Raspberry Pi and even just plain old Documentation.

You'll find source code to most projects that I've worked on over the years on my github profile, as my goal is to use this page as to suppliment those projects for further deep dives.
