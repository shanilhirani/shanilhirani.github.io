## Hello, Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shanil, and I've been working as a Cloud Developer / DevOps Engineer in various sectors, including the Public Sector (UK Govt), UK Financial Services, Energy, and Logistics.

### What I Do

I design, build, and assist people on their cloudy journey. While I'm cloud-agnostic, I personally prefer working with **AWS** and **GCP**. Occasionally, I like to tinker with **Azure**.

### How long have I been in Tech

For over a decade, I've held various titles, but now, I specialize in Cloud/DevOps/Automation.

### What I've learned along the way

- Public Cloud (AWS, Azure & GCP)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform & Cloudformation)
- Configuration Management (Packer & Ansible)
- Shell/Scripting (Bash and PoSH)
- CI/CD (GitHub, Gitlab, and even Jenkins)
- SysAdmin (Windows) and VirtualAdmin (VMWare, Hyper-V)
