# Hello, Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shanil and you've just landed on my portfolio. Feel to have a look around where you'll get an idea of what I've worked on including the tech stack/tooling.

I'd also suggest you have a gander at my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/shanilhirani) for any code, lab'ing or tinkering that I may be up too.
