# Hello, Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shanil and you've just landed on my Bucket of Stuff Page. If you haven't already, I'd suggest you take a look at my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/shanilhirani) to read about me and what I've worked on, as this page is just another **object** in my [Bucket of Stuff](#shanils-bucket-of-stuff)

## Shanils' Bucket of Stuff

What is Bucket of Stuff?

Bucket of Stuff is simply just a phrase that I use to talk about my ramblings in the tech. It could be anything from AWS, Azure, IaaC, DevOps, Raspberry Pi Project and even just plain old Documentation.

You'll find source code to some projects that I've worked in my GitHub profile, as my goal is to use this page to suppliment those projects for further reading and deep dives.
